# White_Board!

This is a whiteboard for meetings. More than one person can use it simultaneously. It uses sockets.io for live and fast transmission of data.

Let's have a look, how it looks and works.

1. This is the first look, when you click on the link: https://white-board.onrender.com/

3. The first tool is 'Pen'
-> On single click, you can select the pen with default width and color. (However, it's selected by deafalut)
-> On double click, 'Pen-tool-box' opens and you can change the width and color as required.
-> To close the 'Pen-tool-box', again double click on the pen icon.

7. The third tool is 'Download'. Using this you can download the canvas as it is by single click. As soon as you click on it, the file downloads on your system. This is how it looks.

9. The next tool is 'Upload'. You can upload any image on the canvas and it is added in a 'Sticy-Note'. (It has same functionality like 'sticky note', which we will see soon.

10. After that we have, 'Sticky-Notes'
-> On clicking the icon, a new 'sticky note' is created
-> You can take notes on this
-> You can move this note on the canvas by dragging it
-> On clicking the 'Green' button, you can hide the note
-> On clicking the 'Red' button, you can remove the note

10. The last two tools are 'Undo' and 'Redo', which works like 'Ctrl + Z' and 'Ctrl + Y' respectively.
